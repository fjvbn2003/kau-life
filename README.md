앱의 기능은 다음과 같습니다.

1. 커뮤니티(익명 SNS)
2. 학식리뷰(매일 초기화)
3. 강의리뷰
4. 학교 공지사항 확인 및 알림
5. 실시간 열람실 좌석 확인
6. 실시간 스터디룸 좌석 확인
7. 실시간 빈 강의실 확인
8. 학기성적, 누적성적, 장학금수혜내역, 시험시간표 확인 및 알림
9. LMS 접속

처음 앱을 실행하면 로그인 페이지가 뜰 텐데, 여기에 아이디 비밀번호는 본인 학교 계정을 입력하시면 됩니다.

공지사항, 장학금, 학점, 시험 시간표가 새로 등록되면 푸쉬알림을 주고 각 알림을 켜거나 끌 수 있습니다.

플레이 스토어 주소는 다음과 같습니다.
play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.lifekau.android.lifekau

그리고 학우들 중에 기능을 추가하고 싶은 학우들은 이슈나 풀 리퀘스트는 언제든지 환영입니다.
